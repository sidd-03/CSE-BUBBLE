************************************************************** README ***************************************************************

1. The file "final_test_bench.v" is the final test bench used for testing.
2. All the required modules are included as header files. You do not need to compile all of them separately.

3. The "VEDA_MIPS.v" is the VEDA memory module.
4. It's Instruction memory (ins_mem) is hardcoded for executing Bubble Sort algorithm.
5. The array elements are hardcoded in the Data memory (data_mem).
6. The value of N(no. of array elemenst) is hardcoded in data_mem[100] (assuming N < 100).
7. The array elements are hardcoded in data_mem[0...N-1].

8. For manual testing, you only need to hardcode values in "VEDA_MIPS.v" file. Rest all the modules will remain unchanged.
9. Hardcode the desired value of N in data_mem[100].
10. Hardcode the desired array elements in data_mem[0...N-1].

11. After compiling and running the "final_test_bench.v" file, the sorted output will be displayed on the terminal screen.
